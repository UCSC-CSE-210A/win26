Hi, I'm [Owen Arden](https://owenarden.github.io/home/)! 
  - Contact: **for anything CSE 210A-related, post or send a DM on the [course discussion forum](https://edstem.org/us/courses/77254/discussion) instead.**  Otherwise: <owenarden@ucsc.edu>
  - Office location: Engineering 2, Room 349A
  - Office hours: By appointment [on Zoom](https://book.morgen.so/owen/office-hours-zoom) or [in person](https://book.morgen.so/owen/office-hours-irl)
  - Pronouns: he/him/his (singular [they](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/grammar/singular-they) is fine too!)
  
## A few essential details about the course

  - Class meets in person {{ site.meeting-time }}, in {{ site.meeting-location }}
  - Canvas (for reading responses and grades): <{{ site.canvas-url }}> 
  - Ed Discussion (for announcements, live chat during lectures, Q&A, communicating with Owen, TAs, and your fellow students, etc.): <{{ site.ed-url }}> 
  - Webpage (here): <https://ucsc-cse-210a.github.io{{ site.baseurl }}>
  - Textbook: [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/), [Volume 1](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/index.html) and [Volume 2](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/index.html) (available free online, but use assignment repo version for all submissions)
  
## Grading
Grading is primarily (90%) based on completion of ~9 homework assignments.
**Class attendance and participation in discussion (10%) is highly encouraged.** 
Attendance is *necessary* but not *sufficient*: 
some lectures may have in-class components like proving things as a group, etc, so please bring a laptop or device that can access your Rocq environment during class.

Full participation credit does not require perfect attendance.  Participation in
80% of lectures (16 of 20) will result in full credit, 75% (15 of 20) receives
half credit, and 0% for fewer than 15. Participating in discussion and other
in-class activities may be considered.  The extra slack is for unforeseen
circumstances that prevent you from coming to class, so **you do not need to
have absences "excused"** (i.e., please don't email me to ask -- as long as you
don't go over 25% you will fine).  If you anticipate missing more than this, you
may want to enroll in a different course.

### Late Policy
- **This course moves fast and has a high workload. It can be very hard to catch up if you get behind.** 
- Late assignments receive a 3% deduction in points for each 0-24 hour period past the deadline, up to 7 days.
- For students with above 75% participation at the end of the quarter, I will remove late deductions the two "latest" assignments. (This is like having late days, but fits better in Canvas's grading policy system).
- **It is very unlikely that additional extensions will be approved, so consider the impact of late submissions carefully.**

## Academic Integrity / AI use

All assignments in this course must be the sole, original work of individual
students.  Discussions with students on general proof strategies and Rocq
techniques are *encouraged*, but should not result in identical proofs.  Looking
at another students' code, whether part of this course or not, is not permitted.
Online resources should be restricted to generic Rocq resources, and should not
be at all related to Software Foundations material or exercises.  

If you see a student's solution by accident, or you feel an online resource
ended up being too close to the answer you eventually submitted, that's ok! 
Just make a private post on the discussion forum that explains what happened
and include a step-by-step explanation of the code in question to demonstrate 
you understand what is going on.


## A note on accessibility

If you have a disability and you require accommodations to achieve equal access in this course, please submit your Accommodation Authorization Letter from the [Disability Resource Center (DRC)](https://drc.ucsc.edu/index.html) to me via the Accommodate system, preferably within the first two weeks of the quarter.  I am eager to discuss ways we can ensure your full participation in the course.

I encourage all students who may benefit from learning more about DRC services to [contact the DRC](https://drc.ucsc.edu/about/contact-us/index.html).
