## Grading
Grading is primarily (90%) based on completion of ~9 homework assignments.
**Class attendance and participation in discussion (10%) is highly encouraged.** Some lectures may have in-class components like proving things as a group, etc.

Full participation credit does not require perfect attendance. Participation in
~75% of lectures will result in full credit. The extra slack is for
unforeseen circumstances that prevent you from coming to class, so **you do not
need to have absences "excused"** (i.e., please don't email me to ask -- as long as you don't go over 25% you will fine).

### Late Policy
- **This course moves fast and has a high workload. It can be very hard to catch up if you get behind.** 
- Late assignments receive a 3% deduction in points
- You should save your late hours for when unexpected circumstances arise that prevent you from turning in your homework on time.
- **It is very unlikely that additional extensions will be approved, so use them wisely.**

## A note on accessibility

If you have a disability and you require accommodations to achieve equal access in this course, please submit your Accommodation Authorization Letter from the [Disability Resource Center (DRC)](https://drc.ucsc.edu/index.html) to me via the Accommodate system, preferably within the first two weeks of the quarter.  I am eager to discuss ways we can ensure your full participation in the course.

I encourage all students who may benefit from learning more about DRC services to [contact the DRC](https://drc.ucsc.edu/about/contact-us/index.html).
